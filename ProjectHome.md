# Vejam Simple User Management, VSUM #
VSUM is a little framework written in php designed to manage the user accounts for web access.
It features user login/logout, user registration with email verification, and has been designed in order to be easily adaptable to any kind of web.
The main goal for this project is to be **simple to implement, use and manage**.

VSUM, is part of [VEJAM](https://code.google.com/p/vejam/) project, but is going to be managed separately, in order to facilitate implementation on other projects.

You can test it on a working demo at [this](http://www.vejam.info/vsum/demo/) link.
Check [Wiki](https://code.google.com/p/vsum/w/list) for usage and implementation.
