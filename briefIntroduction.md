# A brief introduction #

The main objective for VSUM framework is to be easy to implement on a web site.
While developing [VEJAM](http://www.vejam.info/) project i tried to use some existing user management frameworks like [USERPIE](http://userpie.com/) or [USERCACKE](http://usercake.com/index.php) and some others. No one full filled my needs. I found some difficult to use these frameworks also i need a more 'transparent' way to use it on my web site.

So this is another reinvention of the wheel. Enjoy.
